* Each data module has a "series_list"
	>>> series_list[i] = [quandl_code, series_name, asset_class]

* The "codes" attribute refers to i[2] for i in series_list

* QuandlData - "time_series" method:
	- This module will be inherited by all data modules I create
	- This will pull through all columns of the quandl query
	- If you want to pull through a certain column write a custom method in the data module
